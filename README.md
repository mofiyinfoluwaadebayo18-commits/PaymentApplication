# PaymentApplication
Having worked in the Financial Services industry for over two years, I decided to explore and understand how payments work. 
This project interacts with Stripe's API for error handling as well as tokenisation. 
It is written in Java and has 5 classes to handle payment configuration, processing, operation responses, requests and the main application which contains the main method.
As a curious learner eager to put out production ready code, I used Claude AI to enhance my basic implementation.
This project is easy to follow and exposed me to API documentation and integratiion in projects.
